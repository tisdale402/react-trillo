#React Trillo

##Description
This repository contains code that is meant to translate the Trillo example frontend into a full web application. The 
tech stack used to achieve this end will consist of React.js and SCSS, with plans to add a Java Spring backend in the 
future.

##Installation
This application requires npm to run on a local environment. If this is installed, you may simply use the package 
manager to install and run the program by navigating to the top level of the application and using the command

```bash
npm install
```

followed by the command

```bash
npm start
```

##Contributing
