# React Trillo

## Description
This repository is meant to convert the example trillo frontend into a full web application. The tech stack used to accomplish this goal will consist of React.js and SCSS with plans to add a Java Spring backend in the future.

## Installation
The node package manager (npm) is required to run this program on a local environment. Once that is setup, you may install and run the application by simply passing the url to the repo to the command:

```bash
git clone
```

then navigate to the top level of the application and run the command:

```bash
npm install
```

followed by the command:

```bash
npm start
```
